# Chariteth

Chariteth is a blockchain-powered platform that brings transparency, trust, and engagement to charitable donations. Using smart contracts and decentralized governance, Chariteth enables real-time tracking of funds, milestone-based disbursement, and active donor participation through a voting system. Donors are rewarded with experience points (XP) and NFTs for their contributions, creating an innovative and interactive donation experience.

## Features

- **Blockchain Transparency**: All donations are tracked on the blockchain to ensure accountability.
- **Smart Contracts**: Funds are held and released in stages as milestones are achieved, ensuring that donations are used effectively.
- **Decentralized Voting**: Donors have the power to vote on new charity projects, with voting weight increasing based on contribution history.
- **NFT Rewards**: Donors are rewarded with XP and unique NFTs based on their donation levels, promoting engagement and recognition.
- **KYC for Fundraisers**: Fundraisers undergo KYC verification to build trust with donors and ensure legitimacy.

## How Chariteth Works

### Step 1: Donate and Earn XP
Connect your wallet, browse through fundraising projects, and make donations. Earn 1 XP for every 0.01 ETH donated, and level up to unlock exclusive NFTs.

### Step 2: Track Milestone-Based Progress
As the charity reaches certain milestones (25%, 50%, 100%), they submit financial reports and proof of progress, ensuring your funds are used as intended.

### Step 3: Participate in Governance
Donors can vote on pending projects via a decentralized voting system. The more you donate, the higher your voting power!
